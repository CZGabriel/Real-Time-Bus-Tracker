Project Title:
Real Time Bus Tracker

Description of Project:
In this project, we start to learn about APIs which is one of the skills I am most excited to learn. We downloaded local bus route information and used it to track different stops on a map in relation to different locations. This is a really interesting way to see how data can be visualized and used in creation of different web applications.

How to Run:
When you load the project, Click on the show tops button and the marker will move around the screen to show the stops.

Roadmap of future improvements:
It would be interesting to play around with this using a more complicated transportation system such as the NYC subway. I plan to create a similar model which mirrors the subway maps you see in NY with the line showing all of the stops, but without hiding previous stops.
